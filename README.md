Nexus-Like List Chat Integration is a Minecraft Plugin that sends a chat message every 20 minutes with a text and some Links. Once a day you can also redeem a Gold Ingot from the chat message.

## Use Cases
The Plugin is inspired to the old NexusCraft votifier, so you can use this plugin as a "website link spammer", but also as a votifier for all the websites that doesn't have a votifier API to connect to the most popular plugins.

## Usage
This is how the "config.yml" file appears at first
